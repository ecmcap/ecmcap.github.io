An ad built in our competitors' platforms functions only in one very specific way. Every time that ad is needed at a different size, format, or shape, the ad has to be build from the ground up.
Specless separates how the ad displays and functions from the creative content itself. This fundamental difference in engineering means we actually have two independent products:
1) A platform to create ads that can respond and adapt to any size, format, or device
2) A toolset for publishers to define the specifications around how an ad format that they sell looks and functions on their site.
This difference in how ads are created and delivered, means that we have the ability to sell an enabling technology to publishers that allows them to innovate at their own pace for the first time. And with advertisers who build their ads in our platform, they have the freedom to run their ads in any type of media imaginable.
