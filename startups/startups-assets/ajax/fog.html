Enterprise applications are the transactional backbones for enterprises from Apple, Unilever, Facebook & Amazon to government agencies. About 500,000 installations worldwide each run between 10,000 and 500,000 jobs daily. 250,000+ people, mostly outsourced, babysit these applications to keep them running. Typically, some jobs fail every day causing business disruptions, and it takes days of manual troubleshooting to resolve problems and implement fixes to get back on track.
FogLogic's vision is to build a SaaS solution that enables all enterprise applications – whether on public or hybrid clouds or on-premise – to run on auto pilot by combining advanced data science and inter-company collaboration (between the enterprise and its outsourcer) to drive significant productivity improvements alongside vastly improved service levels and far fewer IT-related business disruptions.
FogLogic estimates the annual total available market to be about $11 billion (based on Gartner reports).
