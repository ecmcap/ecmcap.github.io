Inkshares is a traditional book publishing company with one notable exception - readers decide what we publish. Authors submit book ideas. Readers share them, collaborate with our authors, and pre-order our books. We publish books that hit their pre-order goal.

Pre-orders cover our fixed production costs, which greatly reduces our risk. If a book doesnâ€™t sell, the worst we can do is break even. Inkshares probes for hits without losing money.

We recommend books to our user base, and use pre-order funds to run marketing campaigns for our books.

Users form syndicates on Inkshares to support authors each month, and these bring recurring revenue to Inkshares.

We can pay authors 50% of gross revenue for print sales and 70% for e-book sales. This stands in stark contrast to the 15% an author would get from a traditional publisher. Our books are sold on our website and in places like Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble and independent bookstores through our distribution partnership with Ingram.
