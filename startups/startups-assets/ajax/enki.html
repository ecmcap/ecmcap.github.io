Enki is building software which dramatically reduces the barriers to learning and applying technical knowledge. We are building a platform to enable personalized learning, with the touch of a button, wherever you are and for however long you want.

We are disrupting the 600 billion dollars spent improving employees, starting with a bottom-up, mobile approach focused on technology knowledge.

Enki's first product is a mobile app to help professional developers improve their coding skills. The closest analog is Duolingo for coders. 

We work with world-leading experts who craft a curriculum which can be taught in a bite-sized, engaging way on a mobile device. We create examples and challenges, and deliver them to users as part of a daily workout, which is personalized, fun to interact with, and inherently shareable.

Our engagement so far is market-leading for an enterprise product and our users love the app.
