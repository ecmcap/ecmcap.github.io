Pingpad is the social productivity app to get things done, together. The first app to combine collaborative notes, messaging and task management in one. For families, friends, communities, classmates and teams. Works across iPhone, iPad, Android phone and tablet, and web desktop. 

Pingpad is a "Whatsapp for Productivity," with a consumer freemium business model. The mobile shift has already moved email to messaging. It will move Docs to collaborative notes. Pingpad is the first app natively designed for this Social Productivity opportunity, filling the gap between personal productivity and document-centric enterprise collaboration. It complements some enterprise players, like Slack with Pingpad integration. But fulfills unmet needs like class notes, study groups and student organizations on college campuses that works across phone, tablet and desktop.
