Our technology allows for the longest range within FCC limits, fastest location fix, unmatched battery life (1 week+ compared to standard of 1 day) and un-hackable data privacy â€” accomplishing what existing technologies, such as wifi, GPRS and bluetooth, cannot.
In addition to location, Lynq has the ability to discern altitude (above/below) and send messages that are customized and updatable for each B2B customer and their users.
Each transmission sends just a few bytes of data, allowing our signal be received for miles with minuscule power usage. Encrypted transmission allows for a secure point-to-point network.
Low-power architecture combined with intelligent power cycling algorithms manage power usage and provide best in class battery life. A GPS failsafe algorithm provides backup localization functionality in the event that a GPS fails. Custom RF circuitry and switching algorithm allows for greater distance.
