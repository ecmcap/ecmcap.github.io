Kango is a unique mobile marketplace which enables parents to book trustworthy rides and childcare for kids of any age - from preschool to high school. It has an underlying carpool community of 30,000 registered parents and over 12,000 school and neighborhood groups nationwide. 

It's a subscription and transaction fee-based model where parents pay a monthly fee in order to gain access to pre-screened Kango Drivers and Sitters, in addition to paying for each completed ride or sitter session. Rides and care transaction volume and revenue are up 60% MOM in February 2016.

Kango is the only TNC carrier (Transportation Network Company) that is insured to transport kids of any age. 
Kango is also the only Kidsâ€™ transportation carrier that also has a free carpool feature promoted by schools and camps.
