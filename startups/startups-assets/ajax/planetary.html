Planetary Resources’ stated long-term goal is to bring the Solar System within humanity’s economic sphere of influence by developing and deploying technologies for asteroid prospecting and mining. In the near-term, we have identified opportunities to use the same sensor technologies we're developing for prospecting asteroids to serve data and information needs for a number of markets on Earth. We call this information product - Ceres.

Using infrared and hyperspectral sensors deployed in a constellation of Arkyd spacecraft, Ceres provides daily monitoring of natural resources on Earth and delivers actionable, information-rich data to global industries such as agriculture, oil and gas and finance.
