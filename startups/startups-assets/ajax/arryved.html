Arryved enhances the first engagement between a server and a patron, letting a restaurant focus on relationship rather than ordering mechanics. By delivering what a customer wants faster and with less hassle, we change the tenor of conversation between consumer, restaurant, and waitstaff. 

The customer is happy and the server is free to connect. It leads to increased retention and data driven decisions. Consumption analytics drive recommendations based on "Vote By Wallet" instead of positive/negative reviews. 

Arryved accomplishes this first by facilitating a consumer need, next by assisting a restaurant in retaining what it needs, and lastly by feeding big data to build a social network dictated by usage not reviews.
