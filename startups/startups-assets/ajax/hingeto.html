Hingeto is a pre-sell platform that enables established fashion brands to sell every past and future product without inventory risk. Our hack is to turn customers into assets; empowering them to fund production, predict demand and find more customers.

We increase brand’s direct to consumer (DTC) sales and make them profitable before production. Hingeto has begun in the $15 billion U.S. streetwear fashion segment where the founders have helped over 500 brands generate ½ a billion in revenue as leaders at an online retailer. 

We are now alleviating two main problems crushing great brands: 1) speculative production decisions leave them drowning in millions in overstock and 2) middlemen take 70% of a brand's revenue. Hingeto is an extension of a brand's online shop, and powers sales of their thousands of archived products and unreleased goods. Hingeto made up 30% of its largest test brand's DTC sales, making our initial market (streetwear) a $900M direct opportunity for Hingeto.
