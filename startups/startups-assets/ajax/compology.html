WasteOS is the platform that helps waste haulers be more productive and make more money. It has 3 components:
1) Rugged sensors that track dumpster fullness 
2) In-cab tablet app to route drivers to dumpsters that need service 
3) Web-based dashboard for dumpster routing, tracking and analytics
Our model is hardware as a service - no hardware to purchase or software to install. Our customers pay on a per container, per month basis and the power of WasteOS grows as customers scale it from one city to a nationwide network. Our software can be accessed from any internet-connected device and we provide maintenance and support no extra cost.
