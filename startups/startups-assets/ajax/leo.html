Our core consumer facing interface is our mobile app. At launch, the app consists of five core modules covering the five most common tasks parents navigate managing their kids health: 
1) Appointment booking 
2) Messaging your care team and physician 
3) Accessing your kids health record and information 
4) Submitting and receiving forms (schools, camps, sport leagues, etc) 
5) One click payments
In addition, we've built a provider application that allows our staff to communicate directly with our customers, allowing us to escalate and route clinical messages to the clinical team as appropriate.
We are deploying HIPAA compliant and secure video conference (telemedicine) capabilities, beacon-powered auto check-in, and in-practice kiosks for administrative tasks.
We've also built a robust internal API that integrates our tools directly into our practice infrastructure (we use AthenaHealth for Electronic Health Record, Practice Management and Billing Management systems).
