Clect is a global network connecting the high-spending collectors community with a one-stop marketplace where people can browse, sell and collect. 

Right now, most collectors share via Pinterest, get social on Facebook, then buy through eBay.This is inefficient. We are combining all these experiences by creating a home for this fractured audience to not only house their collections to share and sell, but browse the collections of others - turning it into one simple and fun package.

We are launching with the Comic-Con crowd, some of the most passionate collectors of popular culture. They are a community that, in the last year alone, spent $6 billion through eBay and topped two million attendees at the top 10 Comic-Cons globally. We anticipate this targeted launch will allow use to easily scale into other collectible markets, such as sports, coins and music. There are over 200 million serious collectors worldwide and hundreds of millions of hobby based collectors. The market is huge.
