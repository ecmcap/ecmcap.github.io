Skyfront is an aerospace startup that designs and manufactures affordable, long-endurance, autonomous aircraft.

Skyfront’s first product, the Tailwind, is a long-endurance hybrid gasoline-electric drone that flies for 4 hours, 10X longer than existing battery powered drones. The Tailwind is an entirely new type of aircraft that has the capabilities of a manned helicopter but is one hundredth of the cost. 

Skyfront’s technology enables commercial drone applications like package delivery, search and rescue missions, precision agriculture on large farms, and infrastructure inspection, which have largely been unattainable due to range and endurance limitations. 

Skyfront’s current prototype has already demonstrated flight times greater than 3 hours and is capable of 4h15m flights.
