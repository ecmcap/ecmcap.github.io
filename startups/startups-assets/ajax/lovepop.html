Lovepop makes unexpected laser-cut paper art. We are building a brand that stands for doing something special for the important people in your life. Hallmark used to have that brand, but now people view a greeting card as an obligation, not as something special. Lovepop is putting emotion back into cards, and in the process, we're building a sustainable product, brand, and community.
We design, manufacture, and sell directly to consumer online and offline. Our focus is to build the best 3D paper art, completely reinvent the buying experience, and create personalized and customized designs that scream you. To do that we've built the best design team in the world, a uniquely focused production facility with six industrial laser cutters, and are building a customization engine that simplifies invitation creation to a wonderful experience.
Most importantly, everything we do is unexpected. Every time.
