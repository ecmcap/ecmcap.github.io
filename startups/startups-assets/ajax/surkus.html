        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc">
SURKUS was founded with a mission to revolutionize the way people experience their cities, and the way business owners and marketers directly engage with their target audience. Using the power of CrowdCasting, SURKUS elevates venues, campaigns, and events by ensuring the ideal crowd is in place.

SURKUS works similar to a movie casting: through an easy-to-use app, the platform matches people, or SURKUSgoers, with events based on their profile and preferences.

Using a unique proprietary algorithm which collects relevant data from each SURKUSgoer, the system aggregates content from all social media feeds. Influencers are identified, qualified, and recruited (cast). 

Businesses can use SURKUS to incentivize the perfect crowd to attend by minimizing traditional advertising and promotional costs. Through SURKUS, businesses are connected with their ideal crowds, and users get to attend events at must-see venues.
