Snap is a revolutionary flying camera that enables anyone to take spectacular aerial video, anytime and anywhere. Snap shoots beautiful gimbal stabilized 4k video and flies for 20 minutes, but is small enough to fit easily in any backpack, safe enough to use around people, easy enough for anyone to use without experience.

At 500 grams, Snap has 1/10th the system weight of competing products, enabling you to take it anywhere without compromising performance.

Protected propellers make it possible to use Snap without stress and film people without risk.

Smarts like sophisticated auto tracking, auto flight paths, auto ground avoidance, super simple yaw control, and path sharing make average pilots capture extraordinary video.

Magnetic component connections make transportation easy and also let customers extend the capabilities beyond what any consumer flying camera can do to day. Alternative modules enable 1 hour flight time, blindingly fast flight speeds, and obstacle avoidance.
