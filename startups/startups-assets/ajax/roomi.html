Roomi is an online marketplace that connects people looking for rooms and roommates. We are reinventing the way people search and connect in the $441B rental industry. We have created the simplest and safest choice for the housing search, with verified listings, in-app messaging, background and credit checks, and the ability to pay rent, all within one platform.

Roomi solves a huge pain point as the cost of rent has quickly outpaced salary increases in the US. Almost a third of adults now live in shared housing to mitigate rent and associated costs. Millennials increasingly desire a more global, mobile lifestyle. Roomi makes it easy for people to find flexible, affordable co-living solutions that fit their preferences. Users make meaningful connections based on shared values, common interests, and compatible lifestyles. 

We're changing how the rental industry connects people - join us!
