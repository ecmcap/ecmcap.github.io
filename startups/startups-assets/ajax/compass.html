Compass is the leading self-service management dashboard, targeting the 95% of businesses without a Business Intelligence department.

We have created a unique “Analyst as a Service” value proposition by crowdsourcing business performance data. Our product provides real-time benchmarks, integrated reporting and automated recommendations. It effectively replaces the need for an analyst and the purchase of industry data saving companies thousands of dollars and weeks of time. 

The first vertical we’re targeting is E-Commerce.

According to The Economist Intelligence Unit, 90% of business leaders admit making bad decisions for lack of contextual data. Compass provides a business with its key metrics in context and helps them to:

- Accelerate growth with faster, better decisions
- Identify problems that go unnoticed
- Allocate resources where they will have the most impact
- Set goals & objectives based on peer benchmarks
- Save time with automated reporting and analysis
