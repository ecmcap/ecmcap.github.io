TL;DR - We've created an interactive live streaming environment that is dead simple to use, backed by analytics and completely in your browser.
The webinar industry at large is stuck in the 90s. All webinar and enterprise streaming software is designed in the same outdated way where you have to download extra software just to attend the event. But the web has grown up while the slow moving titans in the webinar space has not.
Today there is a new technology called WebRTC. It lets browsers send video & audio directly to each other without the middlemen. In the past year, this technology has matured and now has mainstream browser support. Up until now WebRTC didn’t scale, so only small meetings were possible. However, we found a way to partner with other platforms to scale WebRTC. This means we can now have events with hundreds of people, with no delay and the ability for any viewer to share their video.
We’re the world’s first WebRTC based webinar platform.
