Today over 60% of the total cost of a residential solar system is *not* the panels, but the labor to sell, design, ship, permit and install the system. Installers currently custom-design and build each system hauling hundreds of individual parts to cut, fit and assemble on the roof.
SMASH has developed a pre-assembled, snap-together solar module that directly attaches to the roof. Our SMASH module speeds up installation and reduces training and skilled labor requirements. We are developing advanced manufacturing processes to make our low-cost, high-quality, injection-molded parts replace the custom-installed metal mounting systems used today.
Our patent-pending frameless modules enable solar installers to save money, increase their job throughput and reduce new hire ramp-up time.
