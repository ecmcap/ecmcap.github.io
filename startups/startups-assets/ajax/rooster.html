Rooster is a local sharing community where neighbors share free resources. The benefits of such a community are immense: from reducing our waste and our spending, to getting to know our neighbors, and spreading acts of kindness around us. As Rooster members, we practice unconditional giving and focus on contributing our share. Everything on Rooster is done for free without expectation of pay or reciprocity. Weâ€™re neighbors being neighbors again.
