DailyDrip makes learning easier. Every day our users get a bite-sized piece of something awesome about a topic they are interested in. That could be a short video introducing them to a new skill, a brief reading to bring context to an activity, or a quick exercise. Best of all: it only takes five minutes a day.

In the US alone, there are 7 million IT, Design, and Engineering professionals. They are so busy that it is hard to find time to sit down and learn something new. At the same time, they are pressured to stay on the cutting edge of their field. Daily Drip helps them spend a little time training daily, without interrupting their busy schedules. Most other existing training content is focused on people who can sit down for a few hours to acquire a new skill. The experts at Daily Drip create daily continuing education, tailored for busy professionals.
