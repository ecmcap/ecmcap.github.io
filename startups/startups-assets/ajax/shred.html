Shred Video's artificial intelligence involves video/audio analysis and a video composition algorithm. It's fast: Shred Video only needs about a minute to perform the analysis, processing, and composition for every ~1 hours' worth of footage.
A. Video and Audio Analysis
1. Analyze raw videos to identify key action moments. 
2. Analyze raw music files to A) produce a flexible song remix with seamless transitions; and B) interpret song structure (intro/verse/chorus/beat drop/etc.).
B. Video Composition Algorithm
1. Process video inputs, audio inputs, and user preferences against a series of constraints designed to deliver the optimal movie output. 
2. Permute hundreds of thousands of possible outcomes to find the optimal movie output, using a hill climbing methodology designed for speed.
We have a provisional patent on our video analysis and composition algorithm and methodology.
